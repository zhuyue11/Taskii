# Final Fix Summary: Task Instance Completion Display Issue

## Problem Identified
The task instances were being created correctly in the backend database with status `'COMPLETED'`, but not showing as completed in the UI.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Status Value Mismatch
- **Backend/API**: Uses uppercase status values (`'PENDING'`, `'COMPLETED'`, `'REMOVED'`, `'MODIFIED'`)
- **SQLite Interface**: Was using lowercase values (`'completed'`, `'deleted'`, `'modified'`)
- **UI Comparison**: Checks for `status === 'COMPLETED'` (uppercase)

### 2. Task ID Mismatch
- **Task ID for generateInstances**: Uses `task.serverId || task.id`
- **Instance Filter**: Was filtering by `task.id` only
- Instances weren't matching because they were saved with serverId but filtered by local id

### 3. Field Name Mismatch
- **SQLite Table**: Stores task ID as `originalTaskId`
- **API TaskInstance**: Expects field named `taskId`
- When loading from SQLite, the field wasn't mapped correctly

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated SQLite TaskInstance Interface (`sqliteService.ts`)
```typescript
// Changed from lowercase to uppercase to match API
status: 'PENDING' | 'COMPLETED' | 'REMOVED' | 'MODIFIED';

// Added taskId field for API compatibility
export interface TaskInstance {
  id: string;
  taskId: string; // For API compatibility (same as originalTaskId)
  originalTaskId: string;
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### 2. Fixed Instance Filtering (`HomeScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Changed from filtering by task.id
taskInstances.filter(instance => instance.taskId === task.id)

// To filtering by the same ID used in generateInstances
taskInstances.filter(instance => instance.taskId === (task.serverId || task.id))
```

### 3. Fixed Field Mapping in SQLite Methods
When loading instances from SQLite, now correctly maps `originalTaskId` to `taskId`:
```typescript
return (results as any[]).map(row => ({
  id: row.id,
  taskId: row.originalTaskId, // Map for API compatibility
  originalTaskId: row.originalTaskId,
  status: row.status, // Now uppercase from DB
  // ... rest of fields
}));
```

## Result
Now when a recurring task instance is marked as complete:
1. API creates instance with status `'COMPLETED'`
2. Instance is saved to SQLite with uppercase status
3. When loading from SQLite, `taskId` field is properly mapped
4. Instance filtering matches the correct task ID
5. UI correctly shows the instance as completed

## Testing Steps
1. Create a recurring task
2. Mark an instance as complete
3. The checkbox should show as filled/completed
4. Navigate away and back - state should persist
5. Restart app - state should still persist
