# Implementation Summary: Task Instance Completion with SQLite Storage

## Overview
Modified the app to properly handle recurring task instance completion by storing instances in SQLite and updating the local cache, following the app's offline-first architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (No changes needed)
- API endpoint `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/instances` already supports creating completed instances
- Automatically sets `completedAt` timestamp when status is 'COMPLETED'

### 2. Frontend API Service (`TaskiiApp/lib/api.ts`)
- Updated `completeTaskInstance()` to use POST endpoint instead of PATCH
- Sends `{ instanceDate, status: 'COMPLETED' }` payload

### 3. SQLite Service (`TaskiiApp/services/sqliteService.ts`)
Added three new methods for task instance management:
- `saveTaskInstance()`: Saves or updates a task instance in SQLite
- `getTaskInstances()`: Gets task instances for a date range
- `getTaskInstance()`: Gets a specific task instance

### 4. HomeScreen (`TaskiiApp/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`)
- **Modified `handleInstanceAction()`**:
  - Saves the instance to SQLite after successful API call
  - Updates in-memory `taskInstances` state for immediate UI feedback
  - Reloads the 35-week cache to ensure consistency
  
- **Modified `executeInstanceAction()`**:
  - Returns the API response so it can be saved to SQLite
  
- **Modified `load35WeekCache()`**:
  - Now also loads task instances from SQLite when loading the cache
  - Ensures instances are available for the UI to render

## How It Works

### When marking a recurring task as complete:
1. User clicks checkbox on recurring task instance
2. `toggleTask()` detects it's a recurring instance
3. Creates action with type 'complete'
4. `handleInstanceAction()` is called
5. If online:
   - Calls API via `executeInstanceAction()`
   - API creates/updates instance with COMPLETED status
   - Saves instance to SQLite via `saveTaskInstance()`
   - Updates in-memory `taskInstances` state
   - Reloads 35-week cache
   - Refreshes UI via `loadTasksForCurrentView()`
6. UI shows updated completion status

### Data Flow:
```
User Action → API Call → SQLite Storage → Cache Update → UI Refresh
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Offline-First**: Instances are stored locally in SQLite for offline access
2. **Consistency**: The 35-week cache always reflects the current state
3. **Performance**: No need to fetch instances from API repeatedly
4. **Reliability**: Data persists even if the app is closed/reopened

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Create a recurring task (e.g., daily)
2. Mark an instance as complete
3. Verify:
   - Task shows as completed in UI
   - Instance is saved in SQLite (check logs)
   - State persists when navigating away and back
   - State persists when app is restarted

## Database Schema

The `task_instances` table stores:
- `id`: Composite key (taskId_instanceDate)
- `originalTaskId`: Reference to the parent task
- `instanceDate`: Date of this instance
- `status`: PENDING, COMPLETED, REMOVED, or MODIFIED
- `completedAt`: Timestamp when marked complete
- Additional override fields for customized instances
